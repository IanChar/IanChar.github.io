## About Me

I am a fifth year Ph.D. student in the [Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) at CMU advised by [Jeff Schneider](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~schneide/). My research interests include reinforcement learning, bayesian optimization, and uncertainty quantification. I am particularly interested in how machine learning can be applied to the sciences, and my current research focuses revolve around how we can [learn controls for tokamaks](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/news/2022/ian-char-nuclear-fusion).

Before joining CMU, I earned a MS in [Applied Mathematics from University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/) and was advised by [Manuel Lladser](https://amath.colorado.edu/faculty/lladser/). I also went to University of Colorado Boulder for my undergraduate and earned a BS in both applied math and computer science.
