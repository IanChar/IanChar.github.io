## About Me

I am a machine learning scientist at [Lila Sciences](https://www.lila.ai/). My
research interests include reinforcement learning, Bayesian optimization, and
uncertainty quantification. I am particularly interested in how these topics
can accelerate scientific discovery.

Previously, I was a PhD student in the [Machine Learning
Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University  advised by [Jeff
Schneider](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~schneide/). There, my [thesis](https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Advancing_Model-Based_Reinforcement_Learning_with_Applications_in_Nuclear_Fusion/26253854?file=47589086) revolved around method development for [tokamak control for
nuclear fusion](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/news/2022/ian-char-nuclear-fusion).


Previously, I earned a MS in [Applied Mathematics from University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/) and was advised by [Manuel Lladser](https://amath.colorado.edu/faculty/lladser/). I also went to University of Colorado Boulder for my undergraduate and earned a BS in both applied math and computer science.
