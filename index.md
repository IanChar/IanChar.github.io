## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in the [Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) at CMU advised by [Jeff Schneider](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~schneide/). My research interests include reinforcement learning, bayesian optimization, and uncertainty quantification. I am particularly interested in how machine learning can be applied to the sciences, and my current research focuses revolve around how we can learn better controls for nuclear fusion reactors.

Before joining CMU, I earned a MS in [Applied Mathematics from University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/) and was advised by [Manuel Lladser](https://amath.colorado.edu/faculty/lladser/). I also went to University of Colorado Boulder for my undergraduate and earned a BS in both applied math and computer science.
